# DELANI STUDIO
## Project Description
This is a recreation of a landing page for a fictional studio. I am tasked to implement everything I have learnt from Bootstrap and jQuery.    
Some of the requirements that the project is supposed to meet include:    
- The 'What we do'  icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icon. 
- Create a Hover effect for the **Portfolio ** sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside.
- Make the site responsive.
- Tell the user through a pop up that you have received their message and also thank them for contacting you.
- Use mail chimp API to track all the emails and messages from your users.
- Host your website to github pages.
