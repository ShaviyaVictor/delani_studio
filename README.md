## Project Setup Instructions
The project is set up in such a way that when the user puts in his or her birthday, the application shall generate the day in which they were born and then once they input their gender, the application shall once again output their Akan name that corresponds to the day of the week in which they were born.
#### How the project works
1. Fill in the date you were born.
2. Fill in your gender.
3. Submit the inputs.
4. Upon submission, the application shall generate an output containing the day of the week within which you were born together with your Ghanaian Akan name.
